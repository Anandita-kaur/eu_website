          <br></br>
          It's a great pleasure for me to be a part of the Eternal University as
          its first Pro Vice Chancellor. I take this opportunity of welcoming
          students coming from all parts of the country and abroad, joining the
          university in undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes. The
          mission of the university is to transform and empower young womenâ€™s
          talent through cutting edge education in science, technology,
          education, arts and management amalgamated with spiritual rejuvenation
          for their holistic development to serve the mankind with compassion
          and love. The university is also dedicated to impart quality and value
          based education in the true sense. To do so, the curriculum is updated
          regularly and rectified by the Industry experts and external experts
          from the leading national and international universities as well as
          regulatory authorities. <br />
          The Eternal University was established by Act No. 3 of 2009 by the
          Government of Himachal Pradesh. It is recognized by University Grants
          Commission (UGC), Nursing Council of India (NCI) and National Council
          of Teacher Education (NCTE). The university has got accreditation of
          the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with B Grade
          and very well ranked in Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation
          Achievements (ARIIA) released in 2020. It is one of the few
          universities in the world committed to value based higher scientific
          and technical education as per the vision of Sant Baba Attar Singh Ji
          and Sant Baba Teja Singh Ji effectively translated and implemented by
          Baba Iqbal Singh Ji under the Kalgidhar Trust in close collaboration
          with Akal University, and a network of about 129 CBSE affiliated Akal
          Academies for promoting rural education, women empowerment and
          universal brotherhood for eternal world peace, running in the remote
          areas of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. <br />
          I am happy to share that the university has interesting range of
          subjects available for the students ranging from Humanities to Basic
          sciences, Economics, Commerce and Business Management, Education to
          Music, Nursing and Public Health Care to cater to the needs of the
          rural and urban girls in higher studies with the help of highly
          competent and dedicated faculty through multi-disciplinary streams.
          Students can have the subjects of their choice keeping in view of
          their interest in Research, Placement opportunities and continue for
          higher studies in their chosen field. Research on bio-prospecting of
          medicinal plants and functional foods has been strengthened by
          establishing state of the art laboratory infrastructure through
          institutional, State and Central Government assistance. The campus
          presents an integrated picture of different facilities for the
          students including Wi fi, Bank, Post Office, Bakery, Modern Laundry,
          dairy, farmhouses, Gym, playgrounds including tennis court equipped
          with proper infrastructure and a multi-speciality hospital. I am
          optimistic that the serenity of the campus alongwith a complex
          structure of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities
          will shape your physical, mental and intellectual growth during your
          stay here. <br />
          We are committed to attract the best students through motivation,
          merit scholarships, fellowships and tuition fee waivers and create
          conducive learning environment for value-based education in this
          unique residential and predominantly women student university. I wish
          and assure you, on behalf of the University family, that we will help
          you pursue your objectives of life under the varied social, cultural
          and economic environment and make the University family proud of your
          attainments.
